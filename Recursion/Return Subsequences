Return Subsequences

Given a string (lets say of length n), return all the subsequences of the given string.
Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to n. But the order of characters should remain same as in the input string.
Note : The order of subsequences are not important.

Sample Input:
abc
Sample Output:
"" (the double quotes just signifies an empty string, don't worry about the quotes)
c 
b 
bc 
a 
ac 
ab 
abc 

##Code
def subsequences(string):
    #Implement Your Code Here
    if len(string)==0:
        output=[]
        output.append("")
        return output
    smallstring=string[1:]
    smalloutput=subsequences(smallstring)
    
    output=[]
    for sub in smalloutput:
        output.append(sub)
    
    for sub in smalloutput:
        output.append(string[0]+sub)
    
    return output
    

string = input()
ans = subsequences(string)
for ele in ans:
    print(ele)
